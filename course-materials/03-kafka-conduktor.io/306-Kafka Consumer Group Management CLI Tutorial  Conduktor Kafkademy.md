The Kafka Consumer Groups CLI kafka-consumer-groups is used to manage consumer groups in Kafka. Make sure you have [started Kafka](https://www.conduktor.io/kafka/starting-kafka/) beforehand.

CLI Extensions

Use CLI commands with appropriate extensions for your platform, e.g., `kafka-consumer-groups.bat` for windows, `kafka-consumer-groups.sh` for Linux

## How to reset a Kafka consumer group using the CLI?

To reset a Kafka consumer groups, we need to:

-   Find your broker hostname and port e.g., `localhost:9092`
    
-   Understand the offset reset strategy (to earliest, to latest, to specific offset, shift by...)
    
-   Stop the running consumer groups (otherwise the command will fail)
    
-   Use the `kafka-consumer-groups.sh` CLI with the `--reset-offsets` option
    

## Example: Reset offsets to the earliest

First, ensure that the consumers are stopped ("has no active members")

`1 2 3` `kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --group my-first-application Consumer group 'my-first-application' has no active members.`

Observe the current offsets for your consumer group (same command as above)

`1 2 3 4` `GROUP TOPIC PARTITION CURRENT-OFFSET LOG-END-OFFSET LAG CONSUMER-ID HOST CLIENT-ID my-first-application first_topic 0 3 3 0 - - - my-first-application first_topic 1 5 5 0 - - - my-first-application first_topic 2 6 6 0 - - -`

We will reset the offsets to the earliest position in order to read the topic entirely again

`1 2 3 4 5 6` `kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --group my-first-application --reset-offsets --to-earliest --execute --topic first_topic GROUP TOPIC PARTITION NEW-OFFSET my-first-application first_topic 0 0 my-first-application first_topic 1 0 my-first-application first_topic 2 0`

As you can see the new offsets for that consumer group for all partitions are 0, which means that upon restarting a consumer in that group, it will read from the beginning of each partition:

`1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13` `kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic first_topic --group my-first-application third message fifth message seventh message tenth message first message fourth message eigth message hello world second message sixth message ninth message`

**Note that messages are read in order for each partition, not across partitions (we have 3 partitions in this example) - we will never stop reminding you this.**

## Example: Reset offsets shift by

Stop the running consumers to be able to reset offsets.

Shift by allows you to rewind offsets by a specific value (negative to go back in messages and positive to advance in messages).

`1 2 3 4 5 6 7` `kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --group my-first-application Consumer group 'my-first-application' has no active members. GROUP TOPIC PARTITION CURRENT-OFFSET LOG-END-OFFSET LAG CONSUMER-ID HOST CLIENT-ID my-first-application first_topic 0 3 3 0 - - - my-first-application first_topic 1 5 5 0 - - - my-first-application first_topic 2 6 6 0 - - -`

In this example we reset offsets by shifting by `-2` for the consumer group `my-first-application` subscribed on the topic `first_topic`

`1 2 3 4 5 6` `kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --group my-first-application --reset-offsets --shift-by -2 --execute --topic first_topic GROUP TOPIC PARTITION NEW-OFFSET my-first-application first_topic 0 1 my-first-application first_topic 1 3 my-first-application first_topic 2 4`

As you can see the offsets decreased by 2 for each partition.

Read messages from the topic first\_topic using Kafka console consumer CLI. It will only return last 2 messages from each partition of the topic.

`1 2 3 4 5 6 7` `kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic first_topic --group my-first-application seventh message tenth message fourth message eigth message sixth message ninth message`

### Gotchas

Here are the common mistakes and caveats with the `kafka-consumer-groups.sh` command:

-   **You cannot reset a consumer group if consumers are active in it.**
    
-   This command can be used to reprocess data for a consumer group (in case you have a bug fix)
    
-   This command be also be used to advance message consumption in Kafka (for example if a message is a poison pill, or if your consumer is too slow to catch up with the entire topic).
    

`--all-groups`

Applies to all groups, use with caution

`--all-topics`

Consider all topics assigned to a group in the reset-offsets process, use with caution

`--by-duration`

Reset to offsets by duration

`--dry-run`

Only show the expected result, but does not actually run the command

`--to-datetime`, `--by-period`, `--to-earliest`, `--to-latest`, `--shift-by`, `--from-file`, `--to-current`

All the various options available to you to reset the offsets

## How to list all Kafka consumers in a consumer groups using the CLI?

Listing all the Kafka consumer in a consumer group help you understand where the consumers are placed on your network, and how far they are into the topic consumption.

`1 2 3 4 5 6` `kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --group my-first-application GROUP TOPIC PARTITION CURRENT-OFFSET LOG-END-OFFSET LAG CONSUMER-ID HOST CLIENT-ID my-first-application first_topic 0 3 3 0 consumer-my-first-application-1-0237b0a1-911d-45f1-891f-8fd7630a7593 /172.19.0.1 consumer-my-first-application-1 my-first-application first_topic 1 5 5 0 consumer-my-first-application-1-70ddc756-8dbc-45e4-b5b6-1e5a75db9e62 /172.19.0.1 consumer-my-first-application-1 my-first-application first_topic 2 6 6 0 consumer-my-first-application-1-a8ce2af3-97b3-4445-bba3-f4a5f6c4464d /172.19.0.1 consumer-my-first-application-1`

The `CONSUMER ID` represents the unique identifier of the consumer to the Kafka broker

The `CLIENT ID` represents a client-side setting that you can optionally set to identify a consumer in your consumer groups (with the `client.id` consumer property)

The `CURRENT-OFFSET` is the latest committed offset for that group

The `LOG-END-OFFSET` represents the latest message offset available in the topic-partition for consumption

The `LAG` is the difference of `LOG-END-OFFSET` and `CURRENT-OFFSET` and represents how far behind a consumer is to the tail of a topic.

The `HOST` is the hostname / IP of the consumer client machine.

## How to List of all Kafka consumers groups using the CLI?

Listing the consumer groups help you understand which ones could be down, or not stable.

**Listing consumer groups state**

`1 2 3` `kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list --state GROUP STATE my-first-application Stable`

**Describe all consumer groups and state** (helpful for assignment strategy and coordinator ID)

`1 2 3 4` `kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --all-groups --state GROUP COORDINATOR (ID) ASSIGNMENT-STRATEGY STATE #MEMBERS my-first-application 127.0.0.1:9092 (1) range Stable 3`

You can instead of using `--all-groups` just specify the command for one group only.

Note:

As of Kafka >= 2.1, the "console-consumer-" groups will not appear in the output

## How to delete a consumer group in Kafka using the CLI?

You may want to delete a consumer group in order to reset entirely the reading mechanism. For this, you can use the `delete` option:

`1 2` `$ kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --delete --group my-first-application Deletion of requested consumer groups ('my-first-application') was successful.`

Alternatively, if you want to only delete offsets for a specific topic (helpful when your consumer group is reading from multiple topics) you can use the following command:

`1 2 3 4 5 6 7` `kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --delete-offsets --group my-first-application --topic first_topic Request succeed for deleting offsets with topic first_topic group my-first-application TOPIC PARTITION STATUS first_topic 0 Successful first_topic 1 Successful first_topic 2 Successful`
